This is a project I did sophomore year of high school, largely on my own, though there were nominal team members (Gareth Baldrica-Frabklin and Aaron Goodstein) who contributed some to the content of the game. It was created for the Oregon Game Project Challenge in 2012. It bears the name "Earth2300" and contains a scripting engine, a graphics engine built raw from the swing library (because stubborn 15-year-old me refused to use a serious game library), and some rudimentary AI for the NPCs. Graphics were drawn from hand, except for the aerial photo of Portland.

If I'm using any content I oughtn't be, please let me know and it will be removed. Thanks!
