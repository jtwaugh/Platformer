This is a project I did sophomore year of high school, largely on my own, though there were team members (Gareth Baldrica-Frabklin and Aaron Goodstein) who contributed content to the game. It was created for the Oregon Game Project Challenge in 2012. It bears the name "Earth2300" and contains a scripting engine, a graphics engine built raw from the swing library (because stubborn 15-year-old me refused to use a serious game library), and some rudimentary AI for the NPCs. Graphics were drawn from hand, except for the aerial photo of Portland.

Please open Earth2300 however you like; I used Eclipse but do not store the metadata online.

If I'm using any content I oughtn't be, please let me know and it will be removed. Thanks!
